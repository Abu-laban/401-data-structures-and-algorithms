<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

  - This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- contains
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key
